    <div>
        <p class="text-lg font-mono text-justify pt-6 leading-9">I describe myself as an extremely curious person, passionate about continuous learning and innovation. Since 2020, I've been deeply engaged in the programming realm, where I've found a perfect fusion of my innate passion for logic and creativity. Drawing from my diverse background in musical arts and public policies, I bring a unique perspective to my work. My experience in leading projects has honed my skills in problem-solving, collaboration, and project management, allowing me to navigate complex challenges with confidence. This journey has not only strengthened my technical abilities but has also enriched my understanding of how technology intersects with various fields.<br> Outside of work, I love engaging in sports, exploring gastronomy, and cherishing moments with my family and friends.</p>
